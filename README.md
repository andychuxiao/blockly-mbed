# USE Blockly to build a simpe mbed C code generator

## Background

Graphical Code generator has been a trend nowadays. There is Arduino code generator with Blockly. This project tries to build
a mbed C code generator to help students prototyping their ideas more quickly.

## Ambition

Currently, the following blocks are considered:

   * LED
   * Servo
   * Motor
   * Accelerator Sensor
   * LCD

## Build type

The project is started from [BlocklyDuino](https://github.com/BlocklyDuino/BlocklyDuino), but it uses
out of source build. You need provide "blockly-master/" and "closure-library/" within the same directory to run.
